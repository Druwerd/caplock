= caplock

Adds a lock file to Capistrano deployments.

== Installation

   $ gem install caplock
   
Include in your Capfile
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'caplock'
    
== Usage

Define the name of your lock file in your deploy.rb
   set :lockfile, "my.lock" # defaults to "cap.lock"

If the lockfile becomes stale (because you interrupted the deployment with CTRL-C for example)
   cap lock:release  # or "cap production lock:release" with multistage

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
